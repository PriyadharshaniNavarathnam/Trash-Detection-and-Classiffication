# Trash Classification and Detection

This project aims to classify trash into various categories using deep learning techniques. The model leverages MobileNetV2 for efficient and accurate image classification.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Class Classification**: Detects trash categories like paper, plastic, metal, glass, etc.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily adaptable to other datasets.


## Training the Model
- Open trash_classification.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Update the dataset path and training parameters as needed.
- Execute the notebook to train the classification model.

## Testing the Model
- Use the Streamlit interface (app/app.py) for real-time image classification.
- Alternatively, run the testing cells in trash_classification.ipynb for batch testing.
